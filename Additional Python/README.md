This collection of short python scripts were used to analyse and animate
the data collected from the Synesthetic Composition Application.

They are not part of the SynComp application, just tools used in data analysis and visualisation.

Also included is the code that generated the morphed images, in the application from the
essay and video this was a series of seascape paintings.
